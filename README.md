This was a lot of fun to make. There's a lot of room for improvement, but I learned a lot about some simple ways to minimize global scope, and developed a greater intuition for how to make the most out of functions for repeat tasks, passing values to functions, and keeping things more organized.

Really glad to have stuck it out when figuring out how to build this.
